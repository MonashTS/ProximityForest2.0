    /** Constrained Dynamic Time Warping with cutoff point for early abandoning and pruning.
     *  Double buffered implementation using O(n) space.
     *  Worst case scenario has a O(nÂ²) time complexity (no pruning nor early abandoning, large window).
     *  A tight cutoff can allow a lot of pruning, speeding up the process considerably.
     *  Actual implementation assuming that some pre-conditions are fulfilled.
     * @tparam FloatType    The floating number type used to represent the series.
     * @tparam FDist        Distance computation function, must be a (size_t, size_t)->FloatType
     * @param nblines       Length of the line series. Must be 0 < nbcols <= nblines
     * @param nbcols        Length of the column series. Must be 0 < nbcols <= nblines
     * @param dist          Distance function, has to capture the series as it only gets the (li,co) coordinate
     * @param w             Half-window parameter (looking at w cells on each side of the diagonal)
     *                      Must be 0<=w<=nblines and nblines - nbcols <= w
     * @param cutoff        Attempt to prune computation of alignments with cost > cutoff.
     *                      May lead to early abandoning.
     * @return CDTW between the two series or +INF if early abandoned or, given w, no alignment is possible.

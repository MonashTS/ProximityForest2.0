     * @tparam FloatType    The floating number type used to represent the series.
     * @tparam D            Type of underlying collection - given to dist
     * @tparam FDist        Distance computation function, must be a (const D&, size_t, constD&, size_t)->FloatType
     * @param lines         Data for the lines
     * @param nblines       Length of the line series. Must be 0 < nbcols <= nblines

     * @param nbcols        Length of the column series. Must be 0 < nbcols <= nblines
     * @param dist          Distance function of type FDist
     * @param gValue        Data for the gValue - must have the correct dimension!

    /** Edit Distance with Real Penalty (ERP), with cut-off point for early abandoning and pruning.
     *  Double buffered implementation using O(n) space.
     *  Worst case scenario has a O(nÂ²) time complexity (no pruning nor early abandoning, large window).
     *  A tight cutoff can allow a lot of pruning, speeding up the process considerably.
     *  Actual implementation assuming that some pre-conditions are fulfilled.
     * @tparam FloatType    The floating number type used to represent the series.
     * @tparam FDist        Distance computation function, must be a (size_t, size_t)->FloatType
     * @tparam FGDist       Gap distance computation function, must be a (size_t)->FloatType
     * @param nblines       Length of the line series. Must be 0 < nbcols <= nblines
     * @param nbcols        Length of the column series. Must be 0 < nbcols <= nblines
     * @param dist          Distance function, has to capture the series as it only gets the (li,co) coordinate
     * @param gdist_li     "Gap Value" function distance for lines   (i.e. dist(lines, gv))
     * @param gdist_co     "Gap Value" function distance for columns (i.e. dist(gv, cols))
     * @param w             Half-window parameter (looking at w cells on each side of the diagonal)
     *                      Must be 0<=w<=nblines and nblines - nbcols <= w
     * @param cutoff        Attempt to prune computation of alignments with cost > cutoff.
     *                      May lead to early abandoning.
     * @return ERP value or +INF if early abandoned, or , given w, no alignment is possible

    /** Amerced Dynamic Time Warping, with cutoff point for early abandoning and pruning.
     *  Double buffered implementation using O(n) space.
     *  Worst case scenario has a O(nÂ²) time complexity (no pruning nor early abandoning).
     *  A tight cutoff can allow a lot of pruning, speeding up the process considerably.
     *  Note: if we have  0 < nbcols <= nblines, (keeping the number of columns shorter than the lines),
     *  the memory allocation will be minimized (allocating 2 lines, i.e. according to the number of columns)
     * @tparam F            The floating number type used to represent the series.
     * @param nblines       Length of the line series.
     * @param nbcols        Length of the column series. Must be 0 < nbcols <= nblines
     * @param dist          Cost function of concept CFun<F>
     * @param penalty       Fixed cost penalty for warping steps; must be >=0
     * @param cutoff        Attempt to prune computation of alignments with cost > cutoff.
     *                      May lead to early abandoning.
     * @param buffers_v     Buffer used to perform the computation. Will reallocate if require.
     * @return ADTW between the two series or +PINF if early abandoned.
